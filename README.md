Goals: 
Create a better mobile-first news aggregation service that makes the experience of consuming journalism on a mobile device more pleasurable across various publications/publishers and creates a sustainable economic model for publishers. 

Allow users to tip one another for quality commentary using blockchain micropayments. 

Allow publishers to earn revenue through blockchain verifiable revenue splitting. Users pay a single subscription fee which is then proportionately distributed between the all the publishers from which the users consumed articles. 

Core Technologies: 
React-Redux, FireBase, Web3, Ethereum, GIFY


Work in Progress.
